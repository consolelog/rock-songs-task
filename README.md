Rock Songs
=======================

We've created this task to evaluate how developers tackle a real-world problem. The task should take up to 2 hours for a mid-level front-end developer.

## The Task

Included in this repository is an [index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Streamtime/rock-songs-task/master/index.html) file and a [classic_rock.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Streamtime/rock-songs-task/master/classic_rock.json) file. The page gets a list of classic rock songs from the json file and displays them in a table on the page. There is also a CSS file, but you don't need to worry about that. Your task is to modify the `index.html` file to solve the problems listed below. Remember to also rename the header of the page to include your name.

1) There's a bug in the code which is preventing the list from appearing on the page. Fix it.

2) Modify the code to sort the list by play count, from most played to least played.

3) Implement the search box, so that whenever a key is entered (or deleted) from the search box, the list instantly filters down to only show the songs and albums that contain the full search query, ignoring case.

Note: Have a look at [Backbone.JS](http://backbonejs.org/) to learn more about the javascript framework being used here.

## Submission

Rename the parent directory of these files to include your name, then zip or tar.gz it.
Please email us your solution along with your CV to pius@streamtime.net.
